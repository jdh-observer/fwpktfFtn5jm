## Abstract

When the *Shenbao* was established in 1872, there was no previous history of  journalism in China, neither were there journalists.  In such a context, the basic issue that we can ask is how the newspaper gathered its information and  how its reporting defined the type of individuals who got mentioned in the news. To address the concrete issue of who made it into the pages of the *Shenbao*, and why, we propose a workflow based on the exploration of a randomly selected corpus of articles. Our quest about the eminent Chinese starts with a simple query based on two grammatical words in classical Chinese. This constitutes the vector through which we build our initial dataset, which we further refine to overcome some problems in the nature of the digital edition of the Shenbao. We engage then in an analysis in three steps. The first one is to take the measure of what we find in the pages of the *Shenbao*, with a focus on persons and organizations. This quantitative approach provides a way to rank actors by order of their numerical importance in the cours of the first twenty years of the newspaper.  In the second step, we mobilize network analysis to examine to what extent and how the individual and collective actors were connected. This is a macroscopic approach that places all the actors on the same plane with the discursive space of the newspaper pages across time. Network analysis provides an entry into the articulation between persons and their role in organizations, and it serves to identify why some individuals and institutions happen to be so prominent.  The last step seeks to get into their field of action, namely why  they were newsworthy. We use topic modeling to explore the content of the articles with a dual purpose. The first is to identify categories of articles that can provide as many foci for further analysis and close reading.  The second is to select within the corpus specific figure or groups or types of individuals or organizations that can become the center of detailed study. In this paper, we chose to focus, for example, on the county magistrates (xianzhi).  In this paper, we argue that our approach sheds light on how the *Shenbao* was composed, in particular on its sources of information and on which topics it focused on. In the absence of professional journalists, the *Shenbao* relied on literati who sought their information mostly from official institutions, especially the courts and the police. As a result, the newspaper provides an overwhelming image of multiple disputes (including commercial disputes), acts of delinquency, crime and banditry, social incidents. There is a more diverse range of news, of course, which introduce other types of actors. Yet, by and large, the weight of official institutions as direct or indirect sources of information places officials in the upper ranks of the eminent Chinese throughout the whole period. What we see is a very small elite of public officials involved in managing social order. On the opposite, the newspaper brings to the fore an army of ordinary people who would never have made it into the pages of the *Shenbao*, had it not been because they ran into some sort of trouble. Most just popped up only once.  This exploration of the content of the Shenbao in its early history through digital methods, with a corpus made of more than 40,000 articles, informs us much more accurately on the nature of the information that the newspaper carried and how we should take this into account when using it as a historical source.
